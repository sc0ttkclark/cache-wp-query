# Cache WP_Query

## DEPRECATED

WordPress 6.1 introduces [WP_Query caching](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/improvements-to-wp_query-performance-in-6-1/) which makes this repository no longer necessary. Enjoy!

_Everything below here is from the original readme._

## Description

Cache WP_Query will cache posts from WP_Query through an automatic wrapper. It avoids extra DB requests and caches to object cache. Integrates with ElasticPress to cache those requests too!

## Supports

* [ElasticPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/)
* [Pods](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/) - If active, Cache WP_Query will utilize Pods caches
* [Pods Alternative Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods-alternative-cache/) - through Pods support, you can cache your query results to the filesystem which is handy for those hosting situations with small (or no) object cache setups

## Usage

In your `WP_Query` arguments, set `'cache_wp_query' => true`.

```php
$args = array(
	'post_type'      => 'posts',
	/* complicated arguments with meta lookups, date queries, etc */
	'cache_wp_query' => true, // Cache this query
);

$my_query = new WP_Query( $args );
```

In your plugin or theme, add the post types you want to support for caching (this is primarily for cache clearing purposes when a new post is published). By default, no post types are cached until you add support for one.

```php
/**
 * Add support to my post types for Cache WP Query
 */
function my_cache_wp_query_post_types() {

	add_post_type_support( 'post', 'cache_wp_query' );
	add_post_type_support( 'my_cpt', 'cache_wp_query' );

}
add_filter( 'init', 'my_cache_wp_query_post_types' );
```

Searches are cached by default (assuming post types are all in the list above), but this can be disabled.

```php
// Disable default search caching
add_filter( 'cache_wp_query_search', '__return_false' );
```

ElasticPress caching is enabled by default, but this can be disabled.

```php
// Disable ElasticPress caching
add_filter( 'cache_wp_query_elasticpress', '__return_false' );
```
